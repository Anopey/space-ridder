# space-ridder
 I tend to copy sentences from PDFs a lot for note-taking. However, the copy-paste inserts \n characters and thus creates unneeded new lines in my larger note-taking software screen. This program works to alleviate that by getting rid of isolated \n characters. If \n is used twice in a row it is not deleted as this indicates a new paragraph for the way I take notes.
